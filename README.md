# NBA-Match-Outcome-Prediction
  Basketball is the most accessible sport to the general public. The NBA's influence extends
beyond its borders, and it has innumerable admirers all around the world. It is playable and
viewable. Throughout every minute of play, there is continual movement on both sides of the
court, ensuring that watching a game is never boring and can be an incredibly thrilling
experience. There is ongoing uncertainty, and every team has a fair chance of victory.
Therefore, after examining several themes and datasets and devoting time to selecting and
debating, we opted to experiment with this NBA dataset.
  
  
  As the league involves a significant amount of money and spectators, it is not surprising that
numerous studies have been conducted to attempt to predict its outcomes, emulate winning
teams, evaluate players, and aid coaches. Through the years, a large amount of data and
statistics related to the NBA have been compiled, and each day the data get more rich and
comprehensive. Although  there are numerous variables involved in a basketball game,
prediction is extremely difficult. To attain a high rate of accurate prediction, Machine Learning
techniques have been applied to these data.
  
  
  Therefore, the purpose of this project
 was to determine whether it was possible to anticipate
specific season outcomes based solely on previous game scores and eliminate uncertainty.
Initially, we examined each team's performance from prior seasons and utilized graphs to show
the data. Then, each team was rated based on these graphs. Following this, models were built
and evaluated by the current season data.
